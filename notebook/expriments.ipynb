       "\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of Spain. Let me start by recalling what I know. Spain is a country in southwestern Europe. I remember that major cities in Spain include Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville. Out of these, I think Madrid is the capital. Wait, but I should double-check to be sure. Sometimes people confuse capitals with other large cities. For example, Barcelona is a big city, but I don't think it's the capital. Let me confirm.\\n\\nI can think of some other European capitals: Paris is France's, Berlin is Germany's, Rome is Italy's. Madrid is known for being the capital of Spain. Also, the Spanish government is based there, and it's the political and administrative center. The country's legislature, the Cortes Generales, meets in Madrid. There's also the Royal Palace of Madrid, which is the official residence of the Spanish royal family. Plus, international organizations often list Madrid as the capital. I don't recall any recent changes where the capital was moved. So, yes, Madrid is definitely the capital. The user might be studying geography or just curious. They might also want to know a bit more, like why Madrid is the capital or some facts about it. But the question is straightforward, so a direct answer should suffice. Just need to make sure there's no confusion with cities like Barcelona. I think that's all. The answer is Madrid.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Spain is **Madrid**. \\n\\nMadrid serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. It is home to key institutions such as the Spanish government, the Cortes Generales (parliament), and the Royal Palace of Madrid. The city is renowned for its vibrant arts scene, historic landmarks like the Prado Museum, and its role as a major European hub. \\n\\nLet me know if you'd like additional details! 🇪🇸\""

While an emerging literature documents wide-ranging\\nproductivity effects of AI, relatively little attention has been paid to how AI might change the nature of\\nwork itself. How do individuals, especially those in the knowledge economy, adjust how they work when\\nthey start using AI? Using the setting of open source software, we study individual level effects that AI\\nhas on task allocation. We exploit a natural experiment arising from the deployment of GitHub Copilot, a\\ngenerative AI code completion tool for software developers. Leveraging millions of panel observations on\\nwork activities over a two year period, we use a program eligibility threshold to investigate the impact of AI\\ntechnology on the task allocation of software developers within a quasi-experimental regression discontinu-\\nity design. We find that having access to Copilot induces such individuals to shift task allocation towards\\ntheir core work of coding activities and away from non-core project management activities. We identify two\\nunderlying mechanisms driving this shift - an increase in independent rather than collaborative work, and an\\nincrease in exploration activities rather than exploitation. The main effects are greater for individuals with\\nrelatively lower ability. Our results are robust to alternate identification strategies, bandwidth and kernel se-\\nlections, and variable definitions. Overall, our estimates point towards a large potential for AI to transform\\nwork processes and to potentially flatten organizational hierarchies in the knowledge economy.\\nJEL-Classification: H4, O3, J0\\nKeywords: Generative Artificial Intelligence, Digital Work, Open Source Software, Knowledge Economy\\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for financial and administrative support from GitHub and, in particular,\\nfor generous advice from Peter Cihon.

The printing press, internal combustion engine, and computers\\nare oft-cited examples of such general purpose technologies. Although artificial intelligence (AI)\\nhas existed for some time, many have argued that recent advances may push it into this elite cate-\\ngory of technologies that alter the course of history (Crafts, 2021; Goldfarb, Taska, and Teodoridis,\\n2023; Eloundou et al., 2024). If AI — broadly defined as the use of computers and machines to\\nmimic human intelligence –– is destined to have such a substantial impact, we are likely still at\\nthe beginning of this technological revolution that is slowly and steadily reaching all sectors of the\\neconomy (Acemoglu et al., 2022). Importantly, the highest economic impact of AI is predicted\\nto be on productivity growth through the labor market, especially in knowledge intensive indus-\\ntries (Bughin and Manyika, 2018; Sachs, 2023). However, due to the novelty and breadth of AI,\\nresearch is only starting to elucidate its impact on the nature of work and task allocation in produc-\\ntion settings. This is particularly true of generative AI — a subset of AI built on large-language\\nmachine-learning models (LLMs) — which exploded on to the scene in 2022 and currently repre-\\nsents the cutting-edge of AI. These models, including OpenAI’s GPT4, Google’s Gemini,1 Meta’s\\nLLaMa, and numerous others, are trained on massive, Internet-scale databases and use billions of\\nparameters to construct a probabilistic model that predicts what the next word in an answer to a\\nprompt from a user should be. These models can also be trained on datasets that are more focused\\non specific contexts — e.g., health, finance, customer service, software development, etc. Whether\\nand how these new technologies will shape the nature of work remain open questions. Further,\\nwhether AI can be a complement to skilled workers (Autor, 2024) and help address critical aspects\\nof team production, especially in the context of distributed work, has gone under-explored.\\nAlthough some early studies on generative AI have shown positive high-level productivity\\nimpacts (Brynjolfsson, Li, and Raymond, 2023; Dohmke, Iansiti, and Richards, 2023; Noy and\\nZhang, 2023; Peng et al., 2023), it is less clear what the mechanisms behind these improvements\\nare.

If so, which tasks? How exactly does the work process change\\nwhen using generative AI? To answer these questions, we formulate a set of testable hypotheses\\nthat offer insights into where and why the most salient impacts are likely to occur. Understanding\\nthese impacts informs labor strategy in a manner relevant to both firms (Tamayo et al., 2023) and\\npolicymakers (U.S. Department of Labor, 2024), including hiring policies, work training programs,\\nand upskilling or reskilling efforts for current employees.\\nThe key challenge in testing our hypotheses and assessing how AI changes the nature of work\\nis to identify a setting where (1) work patterns are observable and (2) an AI tool specifically tailored\\nfor workers has been introduced in a quasi-exogenous manner. Our setting — the introduction of\\nGitHub Copilot, a software development generative AI tool, for key developers (known as main-\\ntainers) in open source software (OSS) projects — addresses both of these criteria. OSS source\\ncode is publicly available and permissively licensed for use, modification, and redistribution. Fre-\\nquently developed by distributed teams of developers, OSS is a classic example of a product that\\nis produced through distributed joint work and is generally free (Moon and Sproull, 2002). Al-\\nthough OSS creates societal value on the order of trillions of dollars (Hoffmann, Nagle, and Zhou,\\n2024) and is therefore important in its own right, we argue and provide suggestive evidence that the\\nfindings in this setting generalize to the broader set of work activities that occur in the knowledge\\neconomy. Further, as with many team production settings, OSS also suffers from the “linchpin”\\nproblem (Ballester, Calv ´o-Armengol, and Zenou, 2006; Godin, 2010) as a small set of develop-\\ners are the driving force behind the widely used and incredibly valuable digital infrastructure that\\nhas come to underlie software development and the modern economy as a whole (Eghbal, 2020;\\nGeiger, Howard, and Irani, 2021; Hoffmann, Nagle, and Zhou, 2024). In practice, an influx of non-\\nexperts enabled by decreasing communication costs (Altman, Nagle, and Tushman, 2015) creates\\nan additional burden on developers, who must triage support requests, review contributions, and\\notherwise manage their project’s growing community. Indeed, survey evidence documents that\\nthose maintainers tend to be overburdened with too little of their time spent on their core work\\n(coding) and too much on managerial (project management) tasks (Nagle et al., 2020a).

We start with a panel\\nof 187,489 distinct developers observed weekly from June 2022 through June 2023, which results\\nin millions of developer-week observations for Copilot usage and activity levels in public GitHub\\nrepositories.2 Within the data set of top developers, we find that those who receive free access to\\nCopilot during the general access period increase their relative share of coding tasks while reducing\\ntheir relative share of project management activities. The dynamics of the treatment effects are\\nstable for our two year period. We dig further into the mechanisms underlying these effects and find\\nthat they are driven by an increase in independent behavior (and a related decrease in collaborative\\nbehavior) and an increase in exploration behavior (rather than exploitation). Further, we find lower\\nability developers who receive access to AI increase coding and reduce project management to\\na greater extent than their higher ability peers. The results are robust to the standard regression\\ndiscontinuity design tests and to different estimation procedures including difference-in-difference\\nand matching. Further, the results are consistent when considering whether developers are working\\non behalf of their employers or as volunteers, adding support to the likelihood that these findings\\ngeneralize beyond the OSS setting to a broader set of workers.\\nOur results contribute to a growing literature on the productivity impacts of AI in important\\nways. Early work in this area posits general productivity gains (Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb,\\n2019; Corrado, Haskel, and Jona-Lasinio, 2021; Raj and Seamans, 2018), but that the gains may\\nnot be evenly distributed (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018; Furman and Seamans, 2019).\\nSubsequent empirical work has largely confirmed these predictions and found wide-ranging pro-\\nductivity benefits to using AI, at both the firm level (Czarnitzki, Fern ´andez, and Rammer, 2023)\\n2A GitHub repository is a location where all aspects of a project are stored including its source code, documentation,\\nand revision history.\\n3'),\n",

Particularly related to this study, research fo-\\ncused on Copilot specifically has either been conducted using a much smaller sample of workers\\nwithin firms (Cui et al., 2024) or relying on observational data without the benefit of knowing\\nprecisely which contributors to OSS were given free access to Copilot (Yeverechyahu, Mayya,\\nand Oestreicher-Singer, 2024). Our work is consistent with this prior research but adds additional\\nnuance to the labor augmenting technical change literature (Acemoglu, 2003). By going beyond\\nproductivity to explore how technology changes the nature of work, we provide one of the largest\\nnatural experiments of generative AI and it’s impact on highly disaggregated measures of work\\nprocesses “in the wild” over a two year time horizon.\\nOur main findings identify changes in the nature of work of AI adopters in their knowledge\\nwork processes. We show that when software developers leverage AI more, they reallocate their\\nefforts towards technical coding activities and away from auxiliary project management activities\\nthat involve social interactions with other developers. This is a sign that the workers likely will\\nintensify their core contributions to public goods, such as open source software, when leverag-\\ning skill augmenting technology like generative AI.

For example, in the context of academia, where research and teaching\\nare core work, the result of doing a good job on these is to get promoted and then to be given more\\nmanagerial tasks including department and school committee assignments. This can be summed up\\nby tweaking the well-known phrase “The reward for good work is more work.” to be “The reward\\nfor good core work is more managerial work.” This is particularly true in the context of public\\ngoods which, as public good projects become more successful and more widely used, new users\\nrequest more from those that are creating the good. 3 Thus, the introduction of an AI tool that can\\nhelp reduce some of this burden may play an important role in the creation of public goods. This\\nconcept underlies our theoretical framework as laid out below. We further develop a formal model\\nusing a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function that leads to similar predictions.\\nDetails on the model setup and the comparative statics can be found in Appendix C.\\nBeyond the narrow focus of AI, automation and information systems technologies more gen-\\nerally have been shown to complement skilled labor and lead to a reshaping of organizational\\npractices that allows workers to engage in more complex and strategic activities (Autor, Levy, and\\nMurnane, 2003; Orlikowski, 2007; Zammuto et al., 2007). Further, when technology reduces the\\ncost or effort associated with certain tasks, economic and management theory suggests that work-\\ners will increase the amount of that task they perform (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Bloom et al.,\\n2014). As such, we arrive at the following primary hypothesis:\\nHypothesis 1a (H1a) After the adoption of an AI tool that assists with core work tasks, a worker’s\\ncore work tasks increase as a percentage of all tasks.\\nIn contrast to the impact on core work tasks, the impact of generative AI on managerial tasks\\nis less clear and dependent on the elasticity of substitution between these two types of work (see\\nAppendix C for details).

What is the\\neffect of AI technology on task allocation across specific kinds of core work and project manage-\\nment? We first consider whether workers engage in work that is more independent (less interaction\\nwith others working on the project) or more collaborative (more interaction with others working\\non the project). In the formal model, this can be understood using a nexted model extension of the\\nmain model (details in Appendix C).\\nThis mechanism builds on the idea that generative AI tools reduce (or even eliminate) much of\\nthe cognitive and communicative friction inherent in distributed work, enabling workers to tackle\\ncomplex tasks independently. Prior research has shown that technologies that streamline commu-\\nnication and decision-making processes reduce the overhead of collaboration, freeing workers to\\nfocus on their own work in isolation (Faraj, Jarvenpaa, and Majchrzak, 2011; Aral and Van Alstyne,\\n2011). However, with generative AI, many of these collaborative costs are simply eliminated as\\nwork that previously required communication between multiple people can now be done without\\nany interaction at all. In the context of OSS, a quintessential example of distributed work and our\\nempirical setting, research by Crowston et al. (2008) highlights the importance of collaboration and\\ncoordination in distributed work, but also points out that tools that reduce coordination costs (or\\ncircumvent the need for coordination altogether) can lead to a shift toward individual, independent\\ncontributions. Hence, we hypothesize:\\nHypothesis 2 (H2) A worker’s change in task allocation resulting from the introduction of an AI\\ntool is driven by an increased focus on independent tasks and a decrease in collaborative ones.\\n7'),\n",

When the cost of core work falls, workers\\nmay choose to increase their efforts in established projects or branch out into smaller, more nascent\\nprojects. This distinction between exploration and exploitation is central to organizational learning\\nand innovation theory, as first articulated by March (1991). Exploration involves searching for new\\nknowledge, competencies, and opportunities, while exploitation focuses on refining and optimiz-\\ning existing capabilities. Prior research suggests that when the costs of experimentation decrease,\\nindividuals and organizations tend to shift their focus toward exploratory activities (Benner and\\nTushman, 2003; Levinthal and March, 1993). Further, research has shown that information tech-\\nnology investments, including digital tools, automate routine tasks and facilitate rapid feedback,\\nand thereby promote experimentation and flexibility in task allocation (Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson,\\nand Hitt, 2002; Zammuto et al., 2007). AI in particular has been shown to encourage “learning by\\ndoing,” where individuals are more likely to engage in experimentation because AI tools provide\\nreal-time feedback and help them assess the feasibility of new ideas or projects (Ransbotham et al.,\\n2017). While exploitation remains essential, the newfound ease of exploration and experimenting\\nwith new competencies and projects provided by AI tools makes the latter a more attractive and\\nfeasible focus for workers.

On one hand, lower ability workers may stand to gain more from\\ngenerative AI technology. In particular, for generative AI to function best, the data on which it\\nis trained must be high quality (Wladawsky-Berger, 2023). Indeed, for generative AI’s that are\\ncontext specific, the literature shows that input data filtered for higher quality leads to higher qual-\\nity output (Chen et al., 2021).

In this sense, lower ability workers can be considered “special-\\nists” while higher ability workers are more likely to be “generalists”.

Im-\\nportantly, it is specifically designed for dispersed teams to collaborate on software development\\nprojects, and it chronicles all activities performed on the system to ensure any contributor can\\nobserve all prior activity. Activity on the GitHub platform can therefore provide the researcher\\nunique and granular insights into patterns of distributed work, which are increasingly becoming\\nthe norm in all areas of knowledge work. Furthermore, the platform allows us to observe the de-\\ncentralized production of OSS as a public good. Although the details can be quite intricate, the\\nprimary workflow of a GitHub contributor is straightforward.\\nA user who wants to start a new project creates a repository and then writes their code within\\nthis repository.5 Alternatively, a user may “fork” another repository, which entails copying every-\\nthing from that repository into a new repository so it has the exact same information, but allows\\nthe copier to take the project in a different direction than the primary repository. When the user\\nmodifies project code in a local copy of the repository on their machine, these changes to the code-\\nbase are condensed into a “commit” that attributes authorship to a user. Uploading these commits\\n4According to the Engagement platform 6Sense, GitHub had a market share of 78.81% on March 18, 2024. Further,\\n93% of individuals are using Git as a version control system which underlies GitHub. Other alternatives include\\nGitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, Gitee, SourceForge, SrcHut, to name a few, though all have much smaller market\\nshares than GitHub.\\n5A project’s “repository” is the focal point for collaboration over a particular software codebase. While a repository\\ntechnically refers to the collection of source code files for the project, the GitHub platform hosts the repository\\nand adds important social and project management features for users. Among these features are a detailed version\\ncontrol viewer, a forum to raise issues and discussions, and a formal contribution system based on “pull requests”.\\nThroughout this paper, we will refer to a “repository”, “project”, or “codebase” somewhat interchangeably.\\n10'),\n",

GitHub also has\\npopularized the “pull request” paradigm for OSS contribution in which users without the authority\\nto commit directly to a codebase can contribute to projects by requesting that the project’s main-\\ntainer integrate their proposed changes. For example, if user A maintains a repository and user B\\nwants to add a new feature to it but does not have permission to edit the code directly, user B can\\nissue a “pull request” which includes the suggested changes as a sequence of commits to a fork\\nof the original project. If user A accepts the proposed change, the changes proposed by user B\\nare integrated or merged into the codebase. Finally, any user can report an “issue” for a particular\\nrepository (e.g., identifying a bug or asking for a new feature) and when the issue is addressed, it\\nis considered “closed.”\\n2.2 GitHub Copilot\\nThe empirical focus of this paper centers on the introduction of the generative AI coding tool\\nGitHub Copilot.

Copilot can be used by programmers to generate code snippets for work\\nwhile they are coding that can be easily integrated into the codebase they are working on. As\\na large language model, Copilot operates on the idea of next word prediction, but instead of a\\ntext completion tool, it is a code completion tool with the goal of assisting programmers to code\\nfaster, solve problems more quickly, and learn code that they previously did not know.7 Figure A1\\nprovides an example of how the generative AI Copilot can be used to complete a full function after\\na user generated only the function header.\\n6GitHub Copilot is not the same as Microsoft Copilot which was launched after GitHub Copilot.

It also does not suggest code improvements based\\non pre-existing code but it requires some input from the developer and then provides suggestions based on that new\\ninput (e.g., a function header).

This would\\nimmediately lead to an overestimation of the influence of AI on the nature of distributed work. To\\nmitigate concerns over selection bias, we instead exploit quasi-random variation in Copilot access\\nthrough GitHub’s “top developer” program. To credibly establish a causal effect of Copilot on OSS\\nactivity, we leverage a natural experiment. GitHub awarded free Copilot access to developers of the\\nmost popular public repositories according to an internal ranking. GitHub’s top developer program\\nwas launched at the beginning of the general access period and was at least partially motivated\\nby a desire to support critical OSS infrastructure. GitHub determines that a certain number of\\nrepositories are worthy of ranking and those repositories receive a ranking. The exact calculation\\nof the ranking that determines which repositories receive rankings is not publicly disclosed by\\nGitHub.\\n15Specifically, we use the following cumulative share version:\\nP\\ns≤t ActivityitP\\ns≤t TotalActivities it\\n. While the theoretical framework\\nuses absolute measures, we operationalize it via shares due to (1) the sparsity of the measures, (2) to allow for\\ncomparisons of different magnitudes that can be substantially different, and (3) to focus attention on relative task\\nallocation.\\n16Table A5 provides the same statistics for a two year time period that Table A2 shows for one year.

Similarly, GitHub arbitrarily introduced an eligibility threshold for\\ncomplimentary Copilot access, which we normalize to zero so as not to publicly disclose program\\ndetails.

Although we\\nonly use a subset of 187,000 eligible maintainers to allow for a more direct comparison, if we\\nconsider the full sample of eligible maintainers at around 300,000 as the possible beneficiaries of\\nusage of Copilot, extrapolating this average effect to the set of all 300,000 developers suggests that\\nGitHub Copilot can improve the aggregate value of labor market potential by roughly $468 million\\nper year. While this measure is purely a back-of-the-envelope without taking into account general\\nequilibrium effects, we believe that this estimate substantially underestimates the true value since\\nit does not account for any value derived from improvements that are not due to language-specific\\nexperimentation or due to the productivity benefits of generative AI.\\nOur empirical setting allows us to push the boundaries of existing knowledge about the impact\\nof AI on the nature of work. The primary benefit of this natural experiment is that we are able\\nto observe activities that are driven by AI for a longer period of time (two years) than most prior\\nstudies while still using very granular-level work activity data. On the other hand, a limitation\\nof this study is that we are not observing the exact code that individuals are writing and we are\\nnot precisely observing how individuals are using Copilot. While randomized controlled trials can\\nfocus on this aspect, they often have to restrict themselves to a small set of individuals and a short\\nperiod of time. In contrast, we are able to study the long-run effects of AI on many daily work\\nactivities for a large group of programmers that are extremely important linchpin contributors to\\nthe public good open source software.\\nAnother limitation of this study is that we are only observing contributions to public reposi-\\n26'),\n",

Much of the activity with AI may happen in private repositories and as such, we are likely\\nsubstantially underestimating the impact that generative AI has on coding and project manage-\\nment behavior. Based on our data, we find that 45.5% of Copilot usage happens in weeks where\\nno public (OSS) work activity is observed and GitHub has confirmed that the Copilot activity must\\ntherefore be related to private repository activity by the individuals. Further, there is likely an even\\nhigher fraction of private activity since this activity - while not measurable - is also likely occur-\\nring during weeks where public activities are also occurring. As such, we expect that around 50%\\nof the activity of highly active programmers happens on private and 50% on public repositories.\\nHence, a reasonable estimate for the overall private-public effort could be doubling our estimates\\nconditional on private behavior being affected in similar ways to publicly observable behavior.\\nA further interesting feature of the open source software platform is that private repositories can\\nbecome public over time, which implies that not only will learning from private repositories spill\\nover to public ones due to developers programming with the AI in public repositories but also AI\\ngenerated code may appear at an increased rate over time in the public sphere.\\n7 Conclusion\\nThis study seeks to shine light on the importance of AI, and in particular generative AI and it’s\\nconsequences on work in the information economy. Going beyond the first-level understanding\\nof whether or not it increases productivity, we dig deeper to understand how it changes the nature\\nof work processes of adopters. We find that top developers of open source software are engaging\\nmore in their core work of coding and are engaging less in their non-core work of project man-\\nagement. Both of these main effects are driven by two underlying mechanisms — an increase in\\nindependent behavior (and a related decrease in collaborative behavior) and an increase in explo-\\nration behavior (and a related decrease in exploitation behavior). In particular, the reduction of the\\nneed to collaborate with other humans, leads to humans circumventing collaborative frictions and\\ntransaction costs that would otherwise occur during their work. We further find that the program-\\n27'),\n",

Let the worker’s preferences uθ(·) be indexed by\\nthe parameter vector θ. In each period, each worker chooses c and m to solve the following static\\nutility maximization problem:\\nmaximizec, m uθ(c, m)\\nsubject to pcc + pmm ≤ ω\\n(3)\\nwhere c, m≥ 0 and pc, pm > 0. The choice is constrained by relative costs of each activity,\\np = (pc, pm), and units of an endowment resource, ω.28 In line with simple economic models, we\\nassume that preferences are time-invariant and that there are no externalities.\\nTo improve our understanding of the environment that the worker is in, we assume a constant-\\nelasticity of substitution (CES) utility function\\nuθ(c, m) =\\n\\x10\\nβ1/σ\\nc c\\nσ−1\\nσ + β1/σ\\nm m\\nσ−1\\nσ\\n\\x11 σ\\nσ−1\\n(4)\\nwhere for θ = (σ, βc, βm), σ is the elasticity of substitution between c and m, and βc, βm are CES\\nshare parameters. Without loss of generality, after normalizing pm = 1, pc becomes the relative\\ncost of doing core work. Under the optimal choice of these two activities, the Marshallian de-\\nmands for core work and project management can be expressed as functions of these productivity,\\npreference, and endowment parameters:\\nc⋆ = ωp−σ\\nc\\np1−σ\\nc + βm\\nβc\\n(5)\\nm⋆ = ω\\nβc\\nβm\\np1−σ\\nc + 1 (6)\\nConsistent with prior literature (Acemoglu, Kong, and Restrepo, 2024), we choose to model\\nthe intervention of generative AI as a reduction in the cost of core work, pc.29 As such, the com-\\nparative statics with respect to pc are of interest. A consequence of the CES demand system is\\nthat a reduction in pc increases the optimal level of core work under any value of the elasticity of\\nsubstitution σ >0.\\n28In our setting, the resource endowment ω can be interpreted as the agent’s “task bandwidth” they are able to allocate\\nacross various work activities.\\n29Technically, in a model-free world, it is not ex ante clear how individuals allocate efforts after gaining new time\\nwhen they become more productive since they can allocate their time in whichever way they like.\\n68'),\n",

If we consider the same price shock, due to AI onPc, we arrive at the same\\nconclusion as in the baseline model. The relative demand of the overall composite goodc increase\\nsince the cost of coding has dropped. To understand the relative magnitude, we have to compare\\nthe comparative statics for the within composite good comparison of c1 and c2. When the costs of\\neither one of the two goods is relatively lower (or the preferences are higher) then, we will shift\\nrelatively more of our allocation towards that good. For example, when the price of independent\\ncore work Pc1 is relatively lower than the price of collaborative core work, Pc2 , then individuals\\nare more likely to switch demand to independent work. The same logic holds true for project\\nmanagement as well as exploratory and exploitative work.\\nWe use this model to consider two mechanisms through which the primary relationship oper-\\nates. In the first mechanism, we consider whether workers engage in work that is more independent\\n(less interaction with others working on the project) or more collaborative (more interaction with\\nothers working on the project). Individuals can engage in either independent core work, c1 or col-\\nlaborative core work, c2 or the managerial equivalents, m1 and m2, We find that a reduction in\\nthe cost of core work through AI, pc can increase the demand of core work (as in Hypothesis 1a,\\nbut it does not necessarily need to happen through both independent core work and collaborative\\ncore work simultaneously. Indeed, assuming that the elasticity of substitution σc > 1 and that the\\nprice of independent work is lower than the price of collaborative work,\\npc1\\npc2\\n< 1 implies that the\\nworker will shift their efforts towards independent core work and away from collaborative core\\nwork since independent core work is less costly than collaborative core work. The same holds\\ntrue for managerial work such that σm > 1 and\\npm1\\npm2\\n< 1. While there are reasons to find the\\nalternative parameter spaces,\\npc1\\npc2\\n> 1 (and\\npm1\\npm2\\n> 1) are credible, we find this restricted parameter\\nspace with the pre-existing wedge of prices generally plausible in the context of workers that are\\nalready working in a highly collaborative setting like the increasingly common paradigm of dis-\\ntributed work. We hypothesize that their main issues — collaborative frictions such as the cost of\\ncoordination, requests from others to solve problems, or personal conflicts — may be more costly\\nthan solving problems by themselves when they have AI as a substitute available at any time.\\nThe second mechanism we consider is whether workers that use AI alter their relative inten-\\nsity of exploration versus exploitation in task allocation. When the cost of core work falls, work-\\ners may choose to increase their efforts in established projects or branch out into smaller, more\\nnascent projects. In the nested CES framework, we can decompose both core work and managerial\\nwork into two components where c1 and m1 relate to experimentation with new competencies and\\nprojects (exploration) while c2 and m2 relate to engaging further in pre-existing competencies and\\nprojects (exploitation). The logic, implications, and parameter space are similar to those from Hy-\\npothesis 2 and are not repeated for brevity. To bound our predictions, we make the assumption that\\nthe cost of experimentation is smaller than the cost of exploitation, which likely holds true in the\\ncontext of distributed work given the complexities and interdependencies that persist in existing\\nprojects versus those that are starting from scratch.\\nTo better understand who benefits most from the introduction of generative AI, a small ex-\\ntension of the baseline model (CES utility as in Equation 4) introduces heterogeneity by allowing\\nthe response to a change in the relative cost of coding to vary by worker ability: σ = {σH, σL}.\\nWe assume that a low ability worker has a relatively higher elasticity of substitution between core\\n71'),\n",

Examples given include OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini, and Meta’s LLaMA. These models are trained on massive internet-scale databases with billions of parameters to predict the next word in a response.\\n\\nI should explain that generative AI is part of AI built on LLMs, which are trained on large datasets to generate text. The key points are the components (LLMs), training data, and the purpose of generating human-like text. Also, note the time frame mentioned (June 2022 to June 2023) indicates when these models became prominent.\\n\\nMake sure to mention the examples provided and the economic impact mentioned in the context, like productivity growth in knowledge-intensive industries. Avoid going into too much detail about the economic studies unless necessary. Keep the answer clear and concise, using the user\\'s own words as much as possible.\\n</think>\\n\\nGenerative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence built on **large-language machine-learning models (LLMs)**. These models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard), Meta’s LLaMA, and others, are trained on massive, Internet-scale datasets using billions of parameters to predict the next word in a response to a user’s input. This enables them to generate human-like text, answers, or content across a wide range of tasks. \\n\\nKey characteristics include:  \\n1. **Training Data**: Derived from vast internet-scale databases.  \\n2. **Functionality**: Focuses on generating coherent, contextually relevant text or responses.  \\n3. **Applications**: Used in knowledge-intensive industries to impact productivity and task allocation in production settings.  \\n\\nThe context highlights its emergence and economic significance, particularly in labor markets and productivity growth, as of June 2022 to June 2023.'"
